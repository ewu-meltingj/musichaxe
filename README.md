# musichaxe

Learning how to use haxe by making a simple music game.

## To Run
* Flambe must be installed.
* $npm install
* $gulp

## Notes
I am currently learning how to add multiple textures to an entity. Not sure if making custom sprites is a good solution or if I need to dive further into Graphics.

I have deleted sound output when pressing a light. It will be re added once I understand Connections further.
